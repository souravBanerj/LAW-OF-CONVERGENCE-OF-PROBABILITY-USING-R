# LAW-OF-CONVERGENCE-OF-PROBABILITY-USING-R
PLOT A GRAPH FOR LAW OF CONVERGENCE OF PROBABILITY USING R PROGRAMMING
In this project we have given a sample data set and we have to show that it will follow the convergence probability for the given data
1.First step is to create a sample of size 500 using simple function
2.Find the empirical probability using the formula P(|xn-x|<e)--->1
3.plot the graph between Empirical probability VS Sample size 
4.Conclusion you can see that the graph will converge to 1
